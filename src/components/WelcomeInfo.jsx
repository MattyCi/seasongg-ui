                    One game isn't enough to determine who is the best. A true champion can
                    only be proven throughout an entire season of games. Season GG allows you to track scores over
                    an entire season, so you can finally prove to your friends that you're better than them.

                    Create a season to get started for free, determine when the season will end,
                    and choose a game to play for the duration of the competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Track the results of each round you play every time your friends get together to play.
                    The better you play, the more points are awarded to you for the round.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the season, whoever has scored the most points (on average) becomes the 
                    season champion.
